# Social-Network

## Description
This Python application emulates social media interactions by utilizing graphs to depict relationships like follows, likes, and comments among users. It leverages the 'Graph' class within the 'graph' module to handle these connections. The software randomly generates user names and establishes arbitrary follow, like, and comment associations. Its core features encompass calculating engagement rates, assessing influence among users, identifying shortest interaction paths, and pinpointing the most engaging path.
